## Summary

In this skill, I used the servo code from before and used it for the crawler. The calibration was taken from whizzer and the buggy was calibrated to the pwm values of 1400 for neutral, 2100 for max forward speed, 700 for max reverse.

For steering, by testing out different values, I found that max right and left pwm values were 700 and 2000 respectively. steering does not require any calibration.
