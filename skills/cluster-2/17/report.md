## Summary

In this skill, we read data from the stock.csv file using the index.js script. The code parses through the .csv and stores the data into 4 different arrays. The these arrays are rendered onto local server and can be accessed through the browser by typing "http://localhost:8080/". index.js uses CanvasJs to plot the graph.
