## Summary

Explored communication between the ESP32 and PC. Created a simple program which would cycle through three differentr modes: Toggle mode, echo mode and echo dec to hex mode.
Toggle mode would toggle the onboard LED when a 't' was entered.
Echo mode would display back the input message as is
Echo dec to hex would display back the entered number in hex format.
Implemented shifting between modes when a 's' was entered
