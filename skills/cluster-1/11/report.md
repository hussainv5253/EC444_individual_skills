## Summary

Created a stopwatch which would start at the press of a button and then count up to 99. On future button presses, the counter resets to zero. An Alphanumeric display is used to display the counter. The stopwatch would also focus on using timer interrupts to update the count rather than using delays in tasks for a much more fine tuned clock.
