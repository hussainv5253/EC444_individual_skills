## Summary

Used features of a real time OS to run 3 different task simulataneously on the EPS32 board. The three tasks were a Binary LED counter, a display showing the direction of counter and a button to change counting direction. The three tasks were created to run simultaneously without any one process holding back the others. Global variables were used for communication between the tasks.
