## Summary

Created a module that gets 4 characters from the console and writes them onto the Adafruit 14-Segment Alphanumeric display. Converted input characters into their Ascii counterparts. Utilized a Bitmap cheatsheet from the Adafruit github repository. Used ascii to reference the characters 16 bit representation for LED display. Communcated with the display using I2C communication.
